        <h4>At the Head of the “Class” CSS Assignment </h4>
        <p ><i><ul>You’ve learned how to style different elements using a class. This is noted in the style<br> 
            sheet with a period in front of it and is called up by spacing once inside an element and <br>
            typing class=”classname”. You can name a class whatever you want (no spaces or<br> 
            punctuation), but for it to work, you must be sure the class is in the CSS as indicated.</i> </p>
            <p>For this assignment—</p></ul>

            
            <p class="one" >• In your classsite folder, create a new folder called c1.<br>
                • In c1, create three files—two HTML files and a CSS file. You will put all CSS in the <br>
                external stylesheet (not yet) and NOT on the HTML file. Save the HTML file as <br>
                coolclass1.html and coolclass2.html and the css as cool.css. <br>
                • Change the page title for both html files to be: <br>
                coolclass1.html title-- First off, I am cool! By Your Name <br>
                coolclass2.html title-- Secondly, I rock! By Your Name <br>
                • In the head, link both files appropriately so they will use the cool.css style sheet (HINT: link the relationship and include the <br>
                type and reference) <br>
                • You will make up your own information (words) and it must be error-free in spelling and grammar. The general theme is <br>
                coolness…so go with it (you can even get your information from the internet, copy/paste, etc., but edit and be sure it is <br>
                error-free and appropriate!) <br>
                <ul><li> coolclass1.html should have an h1 heading, a paragraph, a line, and h2 heading, a paragraph, another h2 heading, <br>
                a paragraph, a line, and then a paragraph with a link to coolclass2.html <br></li></ul>
                <ul><li> coolclass2.html should have an h2 heading, a paragraph, an h3 heading, a paragraph, another h3 heading, a <br>
                paragraph, a line, and a h2 heading that reads These Are Cool… then a numbered list of your top five best cool <br>
                things. After that, another paragraph that includes a link back to the home page (coolclass1.html). <br></li></ul>
                • Once all your pages are created, THEN work on the style sheet. You must style as follows: <br>
                <ul><li> Default/body: Arial font family, size 14, navy blue text with pale pink background <br></li></ul>
                <ul><li> h1, h2, h3: All should be Arial Black with Arial as the backup font; letters should be kerned (spaced) 3 pixels; text <br>
                should have both an overline and an underline <br></li></ul>
                <ul><li> h1 should be centered and all capitals (uppercase) <br></li></ul>
                <ul><li> hot class should be created that uses letter kerning of 6 pixels, hot pink text, italics, and yellow background <br></li></ul>
                <ul><li> cold class should be created that uses bold, bright blue text and pale blue background with a kerning of 20px and <br> 
                set to centered <br></li></ul>
                <ul><li> Lines/rules should be set to have a color set to red and height of 5 px <br></li></ul>
                • Apply the classes <br>
                <ul><li> Apply the .hot class to the last h2 heading on coolclass1.html <br></li></ul>
                <ul><li> Apply the .cold class to the first heading (h2) on coolclass2.html <br></li></ul>
                <ul><li> Apply the .hot class to the final paragraph (the one after the list) on coolclass2.html <br></li></ul>
                • On the stylesheet, comment out at the bottom (just follow the format at the top of a new CSS document-- /* words */) <br>
                Stylesheet created by your Name (so you will know it belongs to you when you print it) <br>
                • Preview everything in Internet Explorer and check to be sure everything is showing up properly (especially look for the <br>
                under/overlines that don’t appear in Dreamweaver and verify that links are working) <br>
                • Print the CSS style sheet and the codes from coolclass2.html ONLY. (2 printouts) <br>
                • Call me over for a screencheck (scoring guide is on the back of this sheet); have the first page open in IE and be ready to <br>
              click the hyperlink when asked. <br>
                • Put completed scoring guide with attachments in the tray!</p>
